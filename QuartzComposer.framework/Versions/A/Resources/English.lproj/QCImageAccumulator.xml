		<string>Core Image Accumulator</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>An accumulator enables feedback-based image processing for such things as the iterative painting operations or fluid dynamics simulations. It is typically used in combination with Core Image filters.

The "Image" output represents the current contents of the accumulator as an image. The "Image" input allows to set the new contents of the accumulator, provided the "Accumulate" input is set to True. If the "Dirty Rectangle" inputs define a valid rectangle, only this area of the new contents is considered to have changed from the old.

To use the accumulator, create a feedback loop by connecting its output image through a sequence of Core Image filters and passing the resulting image back to the accumulator's input. You can then display the current contents of the accumulator by using the Billboard patch for example.
Keep in mind that feedback-based image processing is not deterministic as results depend on the composition's rendering frame rate.

By default, the accumulator is reevaluated only when necessary (i.e. when parameters of the filters in the feedback loop change), but you can change that behavior by setting the "Evaluate Continuously" option.

Note that you can customize the format of the accumulator to use 8, 16 or 32 bits per pixel. A higher setting will improve precision and quality but require more video memory. If you set the dimensions to (0,0), the accumulator's size will automatically match the dimensions of the current rendering destination.</string>
