		<string>This patch create an image from a QuickTime movie at a specified path.

The movie path is considered absolute if starting with '/', relative to the current user directory if starting with '~' or otherwise relative to the location of the composition file if available.

The QuickTime movie plays according to the time Quartz Composer passes to the patch. By default this time is the same as the one passed to the parent macro patch, which is likely the global composition time. The movie play time can be set manually by setting the timebase of the patch to "External" (this is done through the patch's contextual menu) and passing a time value to the "Time" input.

Note that the movie will loop if its play time is greater than its duration.</string>
